Thrilled to share a recent project: a comprehensive Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI And SQL! This interactive dashboard transforms raw sales data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making. 



Key features and insights include:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): At a glance, the dashboard highlights total sales,total orders, and total quantity sold, along with month-over-month comparisons. 

Sales Trends: A detailed chart visualizes sales performance over time, helping to identify peak ordering periods for better staffing and inventory management. 

Location Analysis: Sales are broken down by store location, allowing for performance comparison across different branches. 

Product Performance: The "Top 10 product sales" section identifies best-selling items, which can inform menu optimization and marketing strategies.

Weekday/Weekend Analysis: Insights into sales patterns during weekdays versus weekends are provided, showing a significant portion of sales occurring on weekends.

This project demonstrates skills in data extraction, transformation, visualization, and business intelligence, turning numbers into a clear visual story.
